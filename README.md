# monkey

Monkey is a programming language and interpreter written in go.

I wanted to know more about the implementation of programming languages so I decided to do some hands on learning by working through:
[Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com) written by [Thorsten Ball](https://github.com/mrnugget) 
Most of this come straight from the book/examples.
